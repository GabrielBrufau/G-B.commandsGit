## __How to install Git ?__
  The installation process is pretty simple you just to go to this page <a href="https://git-scm.com/download">https://git-scm.com/download</a>

## __How we use git ?__
  let's create the first version of our code in the version history.
  so the first thing we need to do, is to set up git inside the folder project.

   > Create a folder named project
 
  Some basic commands
   ```
   mkdir project   //create a folder named project

   cd project      //move to into the folder

   git init        //create the first version of git
   ```
  So now git is tracking all of the folder in project for changes.
So this is the flow let's get started in what provides git for us.

# I challenge you to follow all the exercises

1. If you has installed git in you terminal put `git -v` or `git --version`
this print the git suite version that the git program came from.

  all commands for use git I'm going to put in a file named <a href="./commands-git.md">commands-git.md</a>
